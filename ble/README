All Potnanny BLE plugins should adhere to these guidelines.

1. The plugin must inherit from the BlePluginBase class.
2. The plugin should contain all class-methods, as instances of the class will
   never be created.
3. The plugin must have a class method called 'poll' that accepts a list of
   devices. This method will filter only devices that are appropriate for the
   plugin. Based either on the name of the device, or an address range.
4. The plugin should return a list of results, containing a dict from each of
   the valid devices.
5. If the plugin is not concerned with any of the devices, it returns None.


Poller code example:

  measurements = []

  all_devices = [
    {'address': '11:11:11:11:11', 'name': 'flower care'},
    {'address': '22:22:22:22:22', 'name': 'MJ_HT_V1'},
    ('address': '33:33:33:3:33'),
    ('address': '12:22:34:22:66'),
    ('address': '77:77:77:77:77', 'name': 'flower care'),
  ]

  foreach cls in BlePluginBase.plugins:
    results = cls.poll(all_devices)
    if results:
      measurements += results

The poller app with then parse all discovered measurements/sensors and
insert into the database.

The results returned by a plugin will look like:
"""
[
  { 'name': 'flower care',
    'address': '11:11:11:11:11',
    'measurements': {
      'temperature': 22.1,
      'soil-moisture': 18,
      'light': 11210,
      'soil-ec': 318,
    }
  },
  { 'name': 'flower care',
    'address': '77:77:77:77:77',
    'measurements': {
      'temperature': 24.0,
      'soil-moisture': 22,
      'light': 12000,
      'soil-ec': 780,
    }
  }
]
"""
